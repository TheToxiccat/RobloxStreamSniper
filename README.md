# RobloxStreamSniper
Simple Roblox stream sniper, wrote this because I was bored and didn't find any other working ones.
\n~~Currently slow due to being single-threaded, but feel free to fork it and add parallelization.~~\n
Added multithreading, should be significantly faster, you can also now select whether to sort by biggest, smallest, or interwoven.
Credits to RoSniperX by Lukas Dobbles, I analyzed most of their code to figure out how to write it in python.
